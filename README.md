# Hoot T3 ðŸ¦‰

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) Emoji only Twitter Clone bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

See it live [ðŸ‘‰hereðŸ‘ˆ](https://hoot-t3.vercel.app/)

## What's under the hood?

Here's some of the tech I use under the hood to make this magic happen -

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Clerk.dev](https://clerk.dev)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io)
- [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/)
- [Upstash](https://upstash.com/) for rate limiting

## How do I deploy this?

Follow our deployment guides for [Vercel](https://create.t3.gg/en/deployment/vercel), [Netlify](https://create.t3.gg/en/deployment/netlify) and [Docker](https://create.t3.gg/en/deployment/docker) for more information.

Or, ya know, just `yarn dev` locally ðŸ˜‰.
